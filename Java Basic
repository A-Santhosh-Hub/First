Java is a widely used, high-level, object-oriented programming language designed to be platform-independent. It follows the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) principle, meaning Java code can run on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Key Features of Java
Object-Oriented – Java is based on OOP principles like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, making it modular and reusable.

Platform-Independent – Java code is compiled into bytecode, which runs on the JVM, allowing execution on any operating system with a compatible JVM.

Robust and Secure – Java has strong memory management, exception handling, and security features like a built-in security manager.

Multithreading – Java supports concurrent execution of multiple threads, improving performance in applications.

Automatic Memory Management – The garbage collector automatically removes unused objects, preventing memory leaks.

Rich API – Java provides a vast library of built-in functions for networking, database handling, and graphical user interfaces.

Java Components
JDK (Java Development Kit) – Includes the compiler, debugger, and development tools.

JRE (Java Runtime Environment) – Provides libraries and JVM to run Java applications.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) – Converts bytecode into machine code for execution.

Common Uses of Java
Web applications (Spring, Hibernate)

Mobile development (Android uses Java for native development)

Enterprise software

Game development

Cloud computing

Big data and AI applications
